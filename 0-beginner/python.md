# What is Python?

Python is a popular programming language that was released in 1991.

Things Python language is capable of doing. 
- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify  files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.

Python Syntax compared to other programming languages:
Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

Python can run a command line itself. You have to write python in the command line to open the python interpreter - from there you are able to write anything in the command line. To exit() the python operator type exit() in the command line.

Python indentation is very important because it indicates a block of code. Most common use if four but has to be atleast one.
