# Python Variable Names

A variable can have a short name or a more descriptive name. 

Rules for variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character

A variable name cannot start with a number

A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric 
characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )

Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

Legitimate names:
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

Camel Case - each word except the first starts with capital letter

Pascal Case - Each word starts with a capital letter

Snake Case - Each word is separated by an underscore character
