## Beginner Progress 

### Completed Lessons:
- **[Hello World Program](0-beginner/hello-world.py)**  
  - Time Spent: 20 minutes  
  - Summary: Learned how to print text to the console.
  - Reflections: First time coding in Python! It was simple, but essential for understanding basic syntax.

- **[Basic Syntax](0-beginner/basic-syntax.py)**  
  - Time Spent: 45 minutes  
  - Summary: Understanding basic Python syntax such as indentation, comments, and print statements.
  - Reflections: Python's clean syntax makes it easy to understand for beginners.

### Upcoming Lessons:
- **Variables and Data Types**
- **Basic Arithmetic**
- **Conditionals**

## Intermediate Progress

### Completed Lessons:
- **[Functions](1-intermediate/functions.py)**  
  - Time Spent: 1 hour  
  - Summary: Learned how to define and call functions, work with parameters and return values.
  - Reflections: Functions help make code more modular and reusable. Definitely a fundamental concept in Python.

- **[Loops](1-intermediate/loops.py)**  
  - Time Spent: 30 minutes  
  - Summary: Worked on `for` and `while` loops. Iterated over data structures like lists and strings.
  - Reflections: I now feel comfortable working with loops, which is critical for automating repetitive tasks.

### Upcoming Lessons:

## Advanced Progress

### Completed Lessons:
- **[Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](2-advanced/oop.py)**  
  - Time Spent: 2 hours  
  - Summary: Learned about classes, objects, and inheritance in Python.
  - Reflections: OOP concepts are powerful for building scalable and reusable code. This was a major step forward!

### Upcoming Lessons:
- **Decorators**
- **Generators**
- **Advanced Python Libraries**

## Upcoming Goals

- Build more complex projects such as a **web scraper** or a **command-line tool**.
- Explore more advanced topics like **asyncio**, **network programming**, and **working with APIs**.
- Solve more problems on **LeetCode** or **HackerRank** to improve algorithmic thinking in Python.
